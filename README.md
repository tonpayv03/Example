# Example
Question 2

The input data is as follows. Each line contain a student name and his/her score separated by a space.


Example Input:

John 20
Joe 15
Anna 18
John 14
Anna 13
Sam 15
Joe 13


The name may be duplicated (case insensitive) since a person could earn his/her score more than once. Represent this data in any data structure you like.
Write code that give the total sum of score for each student. Choose any programming language or pseudocode you like.


Example Output:

John 34
Joe 28
Anna 31
Sam 15

Question 2.1 (Optional)
Sort the students by name.

Question 2.2 (Optional)
Assume that the data is in a file scores.txt, read the file into your data structure.

Question 2.3 (Optional)
Assume that the data in a file scores.txt is very large (e.g. its size is larger than your computerâ€™s memory) due to many score records of many students. Will the code you wrote for question 2.1 and 2.2 work? If not, what should be changed? Why? (No need to write code, simply explain in words.)
